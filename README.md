## Project Description - UVM_simple_DUT

The main purpose of this repository is to learning UVM to perform functional verification with Systemverilog.
The concepts are applied to implement and test a simple UVM testbench for a DUT (in this case, a ULA was chosen).
It's part of my studies with some courses on UVM and SystemVerilog.

## Topics Covered

- `UVM`
- `Systemverilog`
- `Functional Coverage`
- `External Model in C language`

### üõ†Ô∏è Running project

Inside each folder is a makefile with the following commands options:

- `make run`: Run the project with Xcelium Logic Simulator from Cadence;
- `make gui`: Run the simulation using Simvision's GUI.
- `make cov`:  Run the project with Xcelium Logic Simulator from Cadence with coverage report in prompt.
- `make clean`: remove simulation dump files
